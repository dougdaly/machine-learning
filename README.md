This repo holds demos of Machine Learning applications which aim to bring home key concepts.
## K-Means Unsupervised Learning
There are 3 examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and implementation of the K-means algorithm.</br></br>
The first two examples borrow code from a geeksforgeeks.com tutorial which computes the each part of the K-means algorithm (centroid definition, cluster assignment) separately and puts the intermediate results in a scatter plot. This allows for conceptual understanding of the algorithm and the ability to see how the algorithm converges to its result.</br></br>
The second example applies feature scaling to some dummy data to show how to make the algorithm generate more reasonable clusters.</br></br>
The third example leverages the scikit-learn library to identify the optimal number of clusters. It also uses the Clustering/KMeans library to run the algorithm more simply.
